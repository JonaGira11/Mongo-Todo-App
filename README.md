# Mongo-Todo-App

This app allows you to add Todo to the list and remove them when you have complted. You are also able to edit Todo's
This is a CRUD full stack Todo App using a Node.js framework express for the backend and hosted on heroku. I used a cloud database 
with mongo Atlas to store todo.

## Getting Started: 

- Visit the [live demo](https://sheltered-anchorage-79400.herokuapp.com/todos)
### Features:
- Create Todos
- Edit Todos
- Delete Todos

## Installing: 

clone the repo 
```
gh repo clone JonaGira11/Mongo-Todo-App

```
then install dependicies

```
npm i

## Improvements
I think I could imporve the design overall and give it a cleaner look. The edit functionality could be improved instead of sending you to a whole new page I could make it so that a form appears to live update the todo. I could also add a feature instead of deleting todos when completed display them with a check or crossed out.
